Generally humble about her intelligence, except when she''s actively proving it. Sometimes she''ll have a patronizing attitude to the less intelligent, which ends up landing her in detention and other precarious situations.

Link does show rare moments of overzealous boldness, such as when he twice attempts to confront Ganon in The Wind Waker ill equipped to defeat him. Also, he inadvertently helped Ganon find the Triforce in Ocarina of Time, forcing Link to undo the damage he had caused, and eventually make things better than they were originally. Although Zelda games feature more interaction with friendly or neutral non-player characters (NPCs) than some adventure games, such as the Metroid series, these characters rarely take an active part in Link''s quest which he completes alone. Link is shown to have several family members, such as an uncle in A Link to the Past, an unseen mother in Ocarina of Time who died fleeing the ravages of war, a grandmother in The Wind Waker who raises him in his parents'' unexplained absence, a grandfather from Minish Cap, and the most developed of Link''s relatives, his sister Aryll who plays a critical role in the plot of The Wind Waker. He also has several friends, such as the pirate captain Tetra from The Wind Waker, Tatl the fairy from Majora''s Mask, and the fairy Navi from Ocarina of Time. He also has a utilitarian relationship with Midna from Twilight Princess. His mother and father also appear as spirits in the Link to the Past manga.');
